# TOP-Project-Landing-Page
My first go-round at a landing page &lt;3

For reference:

- [Full design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)
- [Color and fonts](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)

What I learned:
- How to structure content with HTML
- How to style content with CSS
    - How to pull in font from Google
    - How to embed photos and write alt text
    - How to use Flexbox to align content and items

What I will improve:
- Write CSS code more concisely
- First draft of HTML is closer to final div structure
